This project aims to streamline and empower your Ansible automation workflows. With a dedicated "tool" namespace repository, we offer a centralized hub for all your roles and playbooks, promoting collaboration and efficiency.

Key highlights include a versatile shell binary that effortlessly manages requirements from your playbook's requirements.yml file. By automating dependency downloads and installations, you can focus on crafting exceptional playbooks instead. Furthermore, our pre-defined roles, ready for customization, expedite playbook creation, making your automation journey smoother and faster.

Discover the power of centralized automation with Centralized Ansible Tools. Join the open-source community, share knowledge, and elevate your automation game!
